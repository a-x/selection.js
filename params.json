{"name":"Selection.js","body":"### Cross-Browser Selection Utilities\r\n\r\nThis utility provides a window.Selection object with common API for \r\n\r\n* all modern browsers (using window.getSelection())      \r\n* IE5â€”8 (using TextRanges)\r\n\r\nAll modern browsers support window.getSelection(), with the notable exception\r\nof previous versions of Internet Explorer. DOM Selections are still a working\r\nstandard. IE exposes its selection interface through TextRanges, which operate\r\non text characters rather than DOM nodes.\r\n\r\nThis is a simple API to find middle ground between current browsers. A new\r\nwindow.Selection object is created that operates on nodes and offsets (like \r\nDOMRange anchors). By manipulating the DOM you can add support for most Range\r\nfunctionality (extract/clone/deleteContents, etc.) or just implement what\r\nyou need.\r\n\r\nReleased under the MIT license.\r\n\r\n### API\r\n\r\nInclude \"selection.js\" in your project. The global \"Selection\" object is a collection of static methods. It can also be instantiated as an object `new Selection(window)` with the same methods as below but no `window` argument necessary.\r\n\r\n* __Selection.supported__ -- This property is `true` if the browser supports the Selection object.\r\n* __Selection.hasSelection(__*window*__)__ -- Returns true if anything is currently\r\n  selected.                \r\n* __Selection.getOrigin(__*window*__)__ -- Returns an array \\[anchorNode, anchorOffset\\]\r\n  of the current selection's starting anchor (in IE, returns leftmost anchor)                \r\n* __Selection.getFocus(__*window*__)__ -- Returns an array \\[focusNode, focusOffset\\]\r\n  of the current selection's focus anchor (in IE, returns rightmost anchor)                \r\n* __Selection.getStart(__*window*__)__ -- Returns an array \\[node, offset\\] for the leftmost\r\n  anchor.                \r\n* __Selection.getEnd(__*window*__)__ -- Returns an array \\[node, offset\\] for the rightmost\r\n  anchor.                \r\n* __Selection.setSelection(__*window, originNode, originOffset, focusNode, focusOffset*__)__\r\n  -- Sets the selection to include the new origin anchor and focus anchor\r\n  (in IE, origin will be leftmost anchor, focus rightmost)\r\n* __Selection.clearSelection(__*window*__)__ -- Deselects all content.\r\n","tagline":"A tiny JavaScript DOM selection library for modern browsers and IE5-8.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
